## üß† How the MongoDB-Only Chatbot Works

### Query Processing Pipeline

1. **Natural Language Parsing**
   - Uses RegEx and keyword matching to detect:
     - **Indian States**: Delhi, Mumbai, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, etc. (all 30 states)
     - **Years**: 2015-2024
     - **Data Types**: crime, literacy, AQI, power consumption
     - **Query Intent**: trends, statistics, comparisons

2. **MongoDB Query Generation**
   - Automatically builds MongoDB filters based on detected entities
   - Supports multiple states and years in single queries
   - Handles collection-specific filtering (e.g., crime types for crimes collection)

3. **Data Analysis & Insights**
   - Performs statistical calculations on retrieved data
   - Generates collection-specific insights:
     - **Crimes**: Total cases, averages, crime type breakdowns
     - **Literacy**: Average rates, range analysis, regional disparities
     - **AQI**: Air quality assessments, health recommendations
     - **Power Consumption**: Usage patterns, efficiency metrics

4. **Response Generation**
   - Creates formatted, human-readable responses
   - Includes data summaries, trends, and actionable recommendations
   - Provides context-aware insights based on data patterns

  "year": 2020,
  "collection": "crimes"
}

// Multi-state crime comparison
{
  "state": { "$in": ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Bangalore"] },
  "year": { "$in": [2020, 2021, 2022] }
}
```

  "year": { "$gte": 2018 }
}
```

### AQI Data Queries
```javascript
// Air quality in major cities
{
  "state": { "$in": ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Bangalore"] },
  "collection": "aqi",
  "year": 2023
}
```

### Power Consumption Queries
```javascript
// State-wise power consumption
{
  "state": "Maharashtra",
  "collection": "power_consumption",
  "year": { "$in": [2022, 2023, 2024] }
}
```
