# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Enhanced Data Explorer with multi-state filtering, advanced AI insights, and proper visualization for all Indian states. The original issue was that data explorer only showed data for Andhra Pradesh instead of all states. Added comprehensive filtering by states, years, crime types, sorting options, and enhanced AI insights with web research capabilities. Latest tasks: 1) Remove the floating orb from dashboard while keeping the invisible circle that opens AI chatbot. 2) Remove animated dots/particles and change invisible circle to invisible rectangle (150x100px) with same chatbot functionality. CURRENT PRIORITY: Fix login redirect issue (should go to data explorer not upload page), enable file upload in data explorer, show different datasets for logged vs non-logged users, enhance user file analysis to match public dataset quality."

The endpoint supports different chart types and tailors the insights accordingly. The analysis quality matches that of public datasets, providing a consistent experience across all data sources. The dataset filtering works correctly - authenticated users see both public datasets and their uploaded files, while system collections are properly hidden. All the new backend features meet the requirements specified in the review request."

    message: "Completed final comprehensive testing of the TRACITY AI chatbot system. The MongoDB-only chatbot is working correctly with no OpenAI API dependency. The system successfully handles various Indian state queries (Delhi, Kerala, Mumbai), temporal queries (2020-2023), and multi-state comparisons. All responses are generated from MongoDB data analysis and include key findings, recommendations, and trends based on the data. The chat endpoint properly handles user data integration when a user_id is provided. ObjectId serialization is working correctly with no errors. Error handling is robust for invalid queries, non-existent data, and malformed requests. All 28 test cases passed successfully, confirming that the chatbot meets all requirements specified in the review request. The system provides data-driven responses with proper formatting, including emojis and structured sections for key findings and recommendations."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the chat endpoint functionality. The /api/chat endpoint works correctly for all test scenarios. Basic chat queries without user_id parameter (e.g., 'What is the crime rate in Delhi in 2020?', 'Show me literacy rates in Kerala', 'AQI levels in Mumbai') return appropriate responses with insights and data. The data cleaning and ObjectId removal process works correctly, with no ObjectId serialization issues found in the responses. Chat queries with user_id parameter also work correctly, with no 'dict object has no attribute user_id' errors observed. The endpoint properly handles error cases, with invalid queries and non-existent states/years returning helpful messages with 200 status codes, and malformed JSON requests returning appropriate 422 error codes. All tests passed successfully, indicating that the chat endpoint is now working as expected."

    message: "Completed testing of the enhanced AI chatbot functionality. The /api/chat endpoint is correctly structured to handle natural language queries for Indian states, years, and data types as required. The endpoint returns 200 status codes for most queries, but there are implementation issues causing errors in the responses. Backend logs show errors like 'dict object has no attribute user_id' and issues with MongoDB ObjectId serialization. The chat endpoint does correctly generate visual links to the explorer page with appropriate filtering parameters. Testing with various queries (crime rates, literacy rates, AQI levels, power consumption, and comparison queries) shows that while the API structure is correct, there are runtime errors preventing proper data retrieval and insight generation. The endpoint is designed to work with MongoDB-only responses without OpenAI dependency as required, but the implementation has bugs that need to be fixed. The query parsing for Indian states, years, and data types is correctly implemented in the code, but the execution fails due to the mentioned errors. The endpoint is also designed to retrieve data from different collections (crimes, literacy, aqi, power_consumption) as required, but the actual data retrieval is not working properly due to the implementation issues."
